# qg-payload-cms

This code base powers my personal site at [qgriffith.me](https://qgriffith.me) It is using the beta version of 3.0 [payload headless cms](https://payloadcms.com)
It also uses the [payload website template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/beta/templates/website) which combines Payload and a [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/)
front-end.
